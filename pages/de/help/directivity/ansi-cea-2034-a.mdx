Calculates and exports the following curves from a polar measurement:

``Listening Window`` is the spatial magintude average in the range ±10º vertical and ±30º horizontal.

``Early Reflections`` curve is an estimate of all single-bounce, first-reflections, in a typical
listening room.
• Floor Bounce: 20º, 30º, 40º down
• Ceiling Bounce: 40º, 50º, 60º up
• Front Wall Bounce: 0º, ± 10º, ± 20º, ± 30º horizontal
• Side Wall Bounces: ± 40º, ± 50º, ± 60º, ± 70º, ± 80º horizontal
• Rear Wall Bounces: 180º, ± 90º horizontal

``Sound power`` is the weighted rms average of all measurements, with individual measurements weighted according to the portion of the spherical surface that they represent.

Sound Power Directivity Index (SPDI) is defined as the difference between the ``listening window`` curve and the ``sound power`` curve. An SPDI of 0 dB indicates omnidirectional radiation. The larger the SPDI, the more directional the loudspeaker is in the direction of the reference axis.

Early Reflections Directivity Index (ERDI) is defined as the difference between the ``listening window`` curve and the ``early reflections`` curve.
