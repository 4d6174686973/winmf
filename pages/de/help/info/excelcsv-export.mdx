# Export to Excel/CSV

In ``Write options`` the settings for the export procedure are configured. Format offers the options ``Excel`` and ``CSV``. If ``Excel`` is chosen, also the ``Excel-sheet`` to write into can be defined, as well as the insert point in the cell array (``Insert at cell``).

``Append data``: The data is written behind potential content already present in the file.

``Offset to cell``: If the offset is 0, ``Append`` data starts writing into the first empty cell behind the data already present, otherwise that starting point is shifted further by the offset value.

``Use column header`` writes a label for the quantities into the first row of the exported data.

``Use same name`` being activated, the exported file gets the same name as the WinMF file evaluated. Otherwise a user-defined file name can be written into ``Info data file``.

``Cancel`` terminates the export and closes the window, whereas ``Ok`` starts the export procedure.
