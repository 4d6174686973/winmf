# Axes scaling

Under ``Axes setup`` the scaling can be adjusted separately for the x- and y-axis.

``X-mode`` offers the options ``Xlog`` (logarithmic) and ``Xlin`` (linear).

``Y-mode`` allows choosing to display ``Level, Phase`` (displayed cyclical between -180° and 180°), ``Group delay``, ``Rms`` (Root mean square, effective value), ``Real, rms`` (rms of real part), ``Real, level`` (level of real part), ``Imag, rms`` (rms of imaginary part), ``Imag, level`` (level of imaginary part) and ``Phase unwrapped``.

``OK`` applies the selected changes, ``Cancel`` aborts the operation.

These settings can also be made directly underneath the plotting area.
