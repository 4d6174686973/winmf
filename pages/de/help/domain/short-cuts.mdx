# Shortcuts

Shortcuts are allocated keys or key combinations, which directly trigger commands and thus speed up and simplify the handling of WinMF. There are shortcuts invoked by single keys as well as combinations involving the Shift-, Ctrl- or Alt-keys.

All shortcut operations can also be selected conventionally by mouse in the corresponding menus.
Shift-0

| Shortcut              | Description   |
| :------------         | :------------ |
| ``Shift-0``           | Pulls the cursors to the position of the active cursor. (on German keyboards: ``=``) |
| ``1``, ``2``... ``9`` | The number keys activate the corresponding channel, presuming it is present. |
| ``+``                 | Zooms into the region around the active cursor. |
| ``-``                 | Zooms out of the region around the active cursor. |
| ``*``                 | Activates the channel with the subsequent number (cyclic). |
| ``/``                 | Activates the channel with the subjacent number (cyclic). |
| ``Shift-1``           | Shifts the magnitudes of all channels in the frequency domain in such a way, that they have the same value at the active cursor position as the active channel. The phases are not modified. (On German keyboards: ``!``) |
| ``Delete``            | Delete (on German keyboards: ``Entf``) deletes the active channel without further confirmation. |
| ``Shift-Delete``      | (on German keyboards: ``Umschalt-Entf``) invokes the operation Delete region in the time domain, that zeroes parts of the active channel. |
| ``Insert``            | Insert (on German keyboards: ``Einf``) invokes the operation Edit-Read file, which loads additional channels from existing files. |
| ``Escape``            | Terminates the current measurement or the execution of a macro. |
| ``Space``             | Activates the inactive cursor. |
| ``Tab``               | The active cursor is shifted in such a way, that the distance between the cursors (Index values) reaches the next power of 2. The field Cursor 1-2 / Index now shows the value 2^n-1. (Exp. to 2^n) |
| ``Shift-Tab``         | The active cursor is shifted in such a way, that the distance between the cursors (Index values) is reduced to the next power of 2. The field Cursor 1-2 / Index now shows the value 2^n-1. (Red. to 2^n) |
| ``Arrow up`` / ``Arrow down`` | Modifies the display range in the active window. In amplitude diagrams the display range is expanded / compressed around the 0-line; in logarithmic diagrams the entire displayed range is shifted up or down respectively. |
| ``Shift-Arrow up`` / ``Shift-Arrow down`` | Modifies the display range in the active window. In amplitude diagrams the displayed range including the 0-line is shifted up or down respectively; in logarithmic diagrams the range is expanded / compressed. |
| ``Arrow right`` / ``Arrow left`` | Moves the active cursor in the corresponding direction. Combined with Ctrl- the operation is sped up. |
| ``a``                 | Switches between the display modes showing either the active channel only or all channels at once. |
| ``Alt-a``             | Opens the AD/DA menu. |
| ``c``                 | Toggles visbility of the extended comment. |
| ``Shift-c``           | Moves the active cursor to the center of the displayed area. |
| ``d``                 | Calls the menu Display range. |
| ``Ctrl-d``            | Sets the readfilepath to the actual filepath. |
| ``e``                 | Expands the display of the active window to the entire time resp. frequency range. The cursors keep their positions. |
| ``Shift-e``           | Expands the display of the active window to the entire time resp. frequency range. The cursors are shifted to edges of the diagram. |
| ``Alt-e``             | Opens the Edit menu. |
| ``f``                 | In the time domain ``f`` invokes the operation Transform-FFT. |
| ``Alt-f``             | Opens the File menu. |
| ``i``                 | In the frequency domain ``i`` invokes the operation Transform-IFFT. |
| ``Ctrl-i``            | In the frequency domain ``Ctrl-i`` switches the display to the imaginary part with linear scaling. |
| ``Alt-i``             | Opens the Info menu. |
| ``j``                 | Sets the active cursor to the minimum of all channels. |
| ``Shift-j``           | Sets the active cursor to the minimum of the active channel. |
| ``k``                 | Editing of the comment. |
| ``l``                 | Activates the left cursor. |
| ``Ctrl-l``            | In the frequency domain ``Ctrl-l`` switches the display to Group delay. |
| ``m``                 | Sets the active cursor to the maximum of all channels. |
| ``Shift-m``           | Sets the active cursor to the maximum of the active channel. |
| ``Ctrl-m``            | In the frequency domain ``Ctrl-m`` switches the display to Level (magnitude). |
| ``n``                 | Opens the channel visibility menu and sets the focus to the input of the active channel number. |
| ``o``                 | Switches the function cursor lock on and off. When activated, the function keeps a constant distance between the two cursors; they can then only be shifted in parallel. |
| ``Alt-o``             | Opens the Domain menu. |
| ``p``                 | Opens the menu Plot/Plotting. |
| ``Ctrl-p``            | In the frequency domain ``Ctrl-p`` switches the display to Phase. |

| ``r``                 | Activates the right cursor. |
| ``Ctrl-r``            | In the frequency domain ``Ctrl-r`` switches the display to the real part with linear scaling. |

| ``s``                 | Opens the filebrowser for saving a file |
| ``Ctrl-s``            | Invokes the function save. |
| ``t``                 | Shifts the display of the active window in such a way, that the maximum of the visible channels is located at the upper edge of the diagram. |
| ``Shift-t``           | Switches the display between Amplitude and Level in the time domain, and between Level and RMS in the frequency domain. |
| ``Ctrl-t``            | Activates the time domain window. |
| ``Alt-t``             | Opens the Transform menu. |

| ``x``                 | Zooms the display to the range between the cursors. |
| ``y``                 | Modifies the range of the display in such a way, that all channels are just about entirely visible. |
| ``Shift-y``           | Switches the display between Amplitude and Level in the time domain, and between Level and RMS in the frequency domain. |
