# Plot mode

For the frequency domain, right underneath the diagram in the main window the display mode of the x-axis can be switched between linear and logarithmic.

The second drop-down menu offers a selection of display modes depending on the domain window:
- Frequency domain: Level, Phase, Group delay, RMS, Real part (linear or logarithmic), Imaginary part (linear or logarithmic), Unwrapped phase
- Time domain: linear (Amplitude) und logarithmic (Level) display

``Act. channel`` shows the currently active channel. All values displayed with the ``Cursor info`` always refer to this channel. The selection of the active channel is possible using keys 1...9, or by stepwise switching up (key *) or down (key /).
