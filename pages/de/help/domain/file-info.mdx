# File info

``Name`` specifies the name of the file that is currently in use. This tag is used to identify the objects present in the working memory, which are listed in the ``Time signals`` menu or the ``Spectrums`` menu. In the case of data being imported, meaning wav-, dat- or spk-files loaded by the ``Import`` functions, the file `name` is automatically transferred into ``Name``. In general however the file name and ``Name`` are not the same, so they are stored as separate items in the header of a WinMF-file.

Rate displays the sample rate of the file.

``#Samples`` displays the number of samples per channel.

``Unit`` describes the physical measurement unit of the Y-axis.

``All channels`` switches between the display modes showing either the active channel only or all channels at once.

``dB reference`` is the reference value for logarthmic description in dB.

``Legend`` inserts a legend into the diagram, where names can be assigned to the individual channels.
