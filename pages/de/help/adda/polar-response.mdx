# Polar response

The ``Polar response`` measurement is an extended version of the [LS sensitivity](/en/help/adda/ls-sensitivity) measurement. In order to measure spatial directivity characteristics a number of sensitivity measurements is performed sequentially from different directions seen from the loudspeaker (or from the microphone). For this either the loudspeaker is rotated (e.g. on a rotating plate or by a [rotating arm](/en/help/adda/elf-v2)) or the microphone is moved ([microphone arc](/en/help/adda/manual)). Usually the data is displayed in relation to the measurement on a pre-defined reference axis.

If all data points are located on a plane, they are referred to as horizontal or vertical directivity, depending on the orientation of the plane; three-dimensional arrangements are called balloon. The angular resolution of the data points usually ranges between 10° and 1°; for not excessively focussed loudspeakers 5° has often been found to be a good compromise between measurement time and accuracy. The relation between source dimensions, angular resolution and measuring distance is described for example in this [paper](https://ifaa-akustik.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tmt-2010-ag.pdf) (in German).

Prior to the actual measurement a reference measurement needs to be carried out by [Ref. - Reference measurement](/en/help/adda/frequency-response-reference).

Basically the measuring configuration is identical to the one in [LS sensitivity](/en/help/adda/ls-sensitivity), only the measuring mode Repeat is not available here.

Additional menus available under Setup are [Turn table setup](/en/help/adda/turn-table-setup) and [Polar data setup](/en/help/adda/polar-data-setup).
