# Set relative exciter level

This function only applies when [recording](/en/help/macro/start-macro-recording) or [executing](/en/help/macro/play-macro) macros and after [Set exciter level](/en/help/macro/set-exciter-level) has been called.

If this menu is called within a macro process, the exciter level is changed by the specified value for all subsequent menus.

Example:

.

.

1Vrms.Set_exciter_level.set

Out1_26dBu.Robo3.set

-20dBFS.ADDA.set % voltage at frontend output = 1Vrms

-6dB.set_relative_exciter_level.set

-20dBFS.ADDA.set % voltage at frontend output = 0.5Vrms

-6dB.set_relative_exciter_level.set

-20dBFS.ADDA.set % voltage at frontend output = 0.25Vrms
