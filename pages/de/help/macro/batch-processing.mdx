# Batch processing

``Batch processing`` allows automatic macro execution for several files in a directory. For this, at first the macro to be used is selected by ``Macro file``.

``Data path`` defines the directory containing the files to be worked on.

If the macro includes any saving operations, e.g. Save, Plot or Info windows (exporting values to Excel files), these files will be stored to ``Result path``.

If ``Data path`` and ``Result path`` are identical, the original data is overwritten by the edited data.

``File suffixes`` defines the file extensions the macro will be applied to. Several extensions can be specified using commas as separator, e.g. .wav,.dat;

``File filter`` selects only those files having the listed strings in their file names. Several strings can be specified using commas as separator, e.g. T1,T10. If the field is left blank, all files with the selected extensions will be processed.
