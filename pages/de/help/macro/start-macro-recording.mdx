# Start macro recording

``Start macro recording`` records the subsequent work steps as a macro. At first, name and file path for the macro file are to be defined. In the same directory for each step setup files are generated automatically, containing settings from the state while recording the macro. The consecutive work steps are now recorded as a text file, until recording is terminated by ``Stop macro recording``.
