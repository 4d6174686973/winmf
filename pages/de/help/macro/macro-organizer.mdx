# Macro organizer

Macro organizer is used for assigning macros to numeric keys or key combinations. For combinations ``shift + numeric key`` and ``control + numeric key`` are available.

``Result path`` defines the directory the results from the macros are stored to.

``Repetitions`` executes the macro as often as defined here.

``Single stepping`` makes the macros execute step by step.

The table contains the assignment of single macros to keys or key combinations. ``Macro File`` selects the macro to be assigned to the button on the right and the corresponding key combination. After selecting a macro, its name and path appear in the field between the buttons.

Right-click on the macro name in the middle column opens the [Macro editor](/en/help/macro/edit-macro).
