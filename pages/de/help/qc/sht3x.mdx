# SHT3X

Reads temperature and relatibe humidity via Arduino over USB and Seed SHT31 or SHT35 sensor. The values will be written into the Logfile if it is used within a QC process. The values are measured when pressing OK.

Additionally, the system clock is read out as time stamp for the measurement.

The comp port settings have to be used with the default values (baud rate 115200, timeout 1s).

The following options can be used:

``Append to title`` appends the values of T and Rh to the title of the plot.

``Append to ext. comment`` appends the values of T and Rh to the extended comment of the file (see [Edit extended comment](/en/help/edit/edit-extended-comment)).

Set to file header writes the values into the header of the files (see [Edit temp, humid.](/en/help/edit/edit-temp-humi))
