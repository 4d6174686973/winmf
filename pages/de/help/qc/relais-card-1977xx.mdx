# Relay Card 1977xx

An [initialization](/en/help/qc/init-relais-card-1977xx) is mandatory after switching on the relay cards. The discovered relay card addresses are automatically entered in the ``relay card 1977xx`` menu and can be selected by choosing them from the ``addr``. pull-down menu. A name can be assigned to each card and to each of its eight single relays. A check mark activates the current supply.

``OK`` transfers the settings and switching states to the relay cards. The relay switching of several cards does not happen simultaneously but with a delay of several milliseconds in between the cards.

For further information please refer to the relay card manual.
