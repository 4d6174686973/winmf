# Load/Save setup as/Default values

Setups for the time domain or frequency domain window can be loaded and stored here. The setup contains all settings and window positions for all the menus and submenus connected to the respective domain window. When loading a setup, multiple pop-ups will ask separately for those menus not specific to the respective domain (ADDA/Initialize, ADDA/Frontend setup and File/Preferences) whether to keep the current configuration or to overwrite by the settings just loaded.

Default values resets the domain window to its default configuration. Again, those menu settings not specific to the respective domain can be kept or reset as well.
