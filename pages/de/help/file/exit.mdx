# Exit

``Exit`` closes all windows and makes WinMF save its current program state in the default.freq.mat and default.time.mat files in the WinMF installation folder. These files are read during the next startup. If they don't exist, all values are reset to default. Manually closing a domain window (X button) is equivalent to the ``Exit`` function from the file menu.
