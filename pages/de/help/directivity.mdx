# Directivity

The *Directivity* section is used for display and editing of directivity measurements created by [Polar response](/en/help/adda/polar-response) or the Monkey Forest measuring system.

Directivity measurements can be measurements in the horizontal and/or vertical plane, which are frequently included in data sheets, as well as three-dimensional balloon measurements used by simulation software like [Ease](http://ease.afmg.eu/), [Ease Focus](http://focus.afmg.eu/index.php/fc-software-en.html), [Ulysses](http://www.ifbcon.de/software/ulysses/e.php), [CATT Acoustic](http://www.catt.se/), and several others.
