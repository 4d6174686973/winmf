# Region

By the drop-down menu `Region` one can select, whether the segment between the cursors or a fixed segment is being considered. The fixed segment can be defined by the parameters ``Lower limit`` and ``Upper limit``. When Region is set to ``all``, the entire frequency range resp. length of time is being considered.
