# Multisine infos

The ``Multisine infos`` window shows information about the [multisine signal](/en/help/edit/multisine-generator) which has just been generated.

First information is the crest factor (ratio of peak to rms value) of the multisine signal.

The next row displays the sum of all conflicts between excitation signal and its harmonics. A conflict occurs when a harmonic of one frequency point matches exactly another frequency point. Such conflicts can be avoided e.g. by using longer signals.

The table shows all the frequency points of the multisine signal in the leftmost column, of which for each harmonic an occurring conflict with another frequency point is indicated by 1 in the corresponding column on the right side; 0 means there is no conflict.
