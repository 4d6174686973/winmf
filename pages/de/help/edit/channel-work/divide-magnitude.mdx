# Divide magnitude

``Divide magnitude`` performs in the frequency range the division of magnitudes of two channels.

[Select region](/en/help/edit/region-control) specifies the region to be considered for the operation.

``|Target| = |Target| / |Source|`` describes the procedure: The quotient of magnitudes of the specified ``Target channel`` and ``Source channel`` is written into the ``Target channel``. The phase is not modified.

``Delete source`` eliminates the specified ``Source channel`` after the operation.

``Go for all`` divides the magnitude of the ``Target channel`` by the magnitudes of all remaining channels.
