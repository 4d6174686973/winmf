# Cross correlation

The cross correlation function (CCF) of the specified channels is calculated. If ``Autocorrelation`` is activated, the autocorrelation function of the channels is calculated. For normalising the ACF or CCF the following options are available
- ``biased``: normalisation to the length of the input signals, so $R_{xy,biased} = \frac{1}{N} R_{xy}$ , with $N$ = length of input signals
- ``unbiased``: The result is normalised as follows: $R(m)_{xy,unbiased} = \frac{1}{N - |m|} R_{xy}(m)$ , with $N$ = length of input signals
- ``coeff``: normalisation to 1 for the centre of the ACFs
- ``none``: without normalisation
