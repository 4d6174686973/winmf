# Add magnitude

``Add magnitude`` performs in the frequency range the addition of magnitudes of two channels.

[Select region](/en/help/edit/region-control) specifies the region to be considered for the operation.

``|Target| = |Target| + |Source|`` describes the procedure: The summation of magnitudes of the specified ``Target channel`` and ``Source channel`` is written into the ``Target channel``. The phase is not modified.

``Delete source`` eliminates the specified ``Source channel`` after the operation.

``Go for all`` adds the magnitudes of all remaining channels onto the magnitude of the ``Target channel``.
