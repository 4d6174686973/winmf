# Log average adjust

``Log average adjust`` is used to shift spectra according to their logarithmic average. The ``Log average`` value assumes a log-log representation (meaning dB over a logarithmic frequency scale). Figuring a constant spectrum (horizontal line) cutting the spectrum under consideration, this line, the spectrum and the frequency limits (vertical lines) form the edges of several areas. Now the horizontal line is shifted vertically, until the sum of areas below and above the line are the same. The y-value of the horizontal line now corresponds to the ``Log average`` value.

[Select region](/en/help/edit/region-control) specifies the region to be considered for the operation.

``Copy act. channel`` copies the Log average value of the active channel into the Target field.

``Copy avg all copies`` the Log average value of all channels into the Target field.

The ``Target`` field defines the target value for the ``Log average`` values after the shifting.

``Select channel`` works as described [here](/en/help/edit/select-channel).
