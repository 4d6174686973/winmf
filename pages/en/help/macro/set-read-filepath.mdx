# Set read filepath

Sets filepath for read operations under Edit/... (during macro processing and also in manual mode).

With activated option ``Use current filepath``, the path is set to
- without macro processing to the last used path for loading or saving files
- with Play Macro to the result path
- within the QC-process to the here defined path (base path, production lot)

Without activating this option, the path is set to the path selected by ``Path``. This path has to be under the base path (base path unter preferences).

This affects the following functions:
- [Edit/read](/en/help/edit/read-file)
- [Edit/read file channels](/en/help/edit/read-file-channels)
- [Edit/read current filename (nur diese Funktion ist makrof√§hig)](/en/help/edit/read-file)
- [Edit/read and insert at active cursor](/en/help/edit/read-file-and-insert-at-active-cursor)
- [Edit/read current filename file and insert at active cursor](/en/help/edit/read-file-and-insert-at-active-cursor)
