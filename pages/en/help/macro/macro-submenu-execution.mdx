# Macro Submenu Execution

Menus, which allow an execution of its submenus in macro processses show an additional entry in  its file menu: ``Macro submenu exec``.

Within this menu, the submenu to be executed can be selected and its execution be activated.

The execution is also shown in the filemenu (checked or unchecked).

The macro execution is in the case of a submenu as follows:

The macro process is
- first the calling menu of  the submenu is only opened
- then the selected submenu is opened and executed
- both menus are closed after execution

The calling menu of the submenu is !not! executed. Should this also be executed, it must be defined as separate step in the macro process.

Example: the menu ADDA/FR for frequency response measurement allows the execution of the reference in the macro process. If this is activated, only the reference measurement is executed. For a subsequent frequency response measurement a second step has to be defined in the process (without ``Macro submenu exec``).
