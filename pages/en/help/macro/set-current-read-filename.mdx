# Set current read filename

Sets the ``current readfile name`` to the string specified under ``filename``. With the ``Use current filename`` option, the name specified in the [Set current filename](/en/help/macro/set-current-filename) menu can be used.

This menu affects the following operations:

- [Read file channels](/en/help/edit/read-file-channels) (with the read current filename option)

- read current filename file

- read current filename and insert at active cursor

To use it in macro or QC mode, you must first specify the file name using Set current read filename and then call Read file channels or read current filename file in the next step.
