# Statistics 

In the ``Info`` / ``Statistics`` section measurements are evaluated and values can be exported.

## Configuration

By the ``Select`` menu the desired parameters are to be selected. In addition statistical values can be calculated from these parameters.

The results are displayed by the ``Info window`` immediately. In there, under ``dBref`` the reference value for dB quantities is to be defined. If power is evaluated, these values refer to the load impedance specified for the respective channel inside the ``Info`` window. The display of load impedances is to be switched on also by the ``Select`` menu; these values can be edited directly inside the table. The input related impedances managed here by the ``Info`` window are independent from the output related load impedances from the frontend menu.

[Region](/en/help/edit/region-control) defines the section to be evaluated.

If [fractional octave filtering](/en/help/edit/frac-oct-filtering) has been performed in advance, the selected parameters can be displayed band-wise. The assignment to the original channels is deposited in the channel tag. The nominal and the exact band centre frequencies can be displayed in the table. The following example shows a 4 channel microphone signal containing motor noise, filtered in 8 octaves for further evaluation:

By selecting Channel tag, fm nom., Crest and Leq the ``Info`` window produces the following output:
