# Decay times

``Decay times`` in the ``Info`` menu performs an evaluation of reverse-time integrated impulse responses (IIR). If no IIR is present in the memory, the [menu for IIR processing](/en/help/edit/integrated-impulse-response-processing) is launched automatically.

At first the parameters to be displayed are to be selected via the ``Select/Select parameters`` submenu of the ``Decay times`` menu.

The analysis is performed according to DIN EN ISO 3382-1:2009 and DIN EN ISO 3382-2:2008. In addition to decay times for the various intervals, the following evaluations and information can be produced:

- channel tag: shows the associated channel number from before the filtering, so the results can be associated to the original channels
- fm nom. [Hz]: nominal band centre frequency according to DIN EN 61620
- fm [Hz]: exact band centre frequency according to DIN EN 61620
- C(...): degree of curvature according to ISO 3382-2:2008, Annex B3. For example C(T20-30) is the degree of curvature for the T20 interval compared to the T30 interval, etc. Typical values are between 0 and 5%, values beyond 10% indicate deviations from the linear shape
- x: degree of non-linearity according to ISO 3382-2:2008, Annex B2. For the respective evaluation interval the squared correlation coefficient is calculated. E.g. x30 calculates a measure for the deviation from the linear regression curve between -5 and -35dB. In contrast to the curvature C, x also detects fluctuations. The value is given in per mil. A value around 0 means no deviation, 1000 is maximum deviation. Typical values for sound IIRs are between 0 and 5 per mil.

Via the ``copy table to spectrum`` button the displayed RT values are copied as spectra to multiple channels in the frequency domain.
