# Integrated impulse response (IIR)

Domain/Int. impulse response switches to displaying the IIR. If there is already a calculated IIR connected to the corresponding time signal, the processing is skipped, otherwise the [IIR processing menu](/en/help/edit/integrated-impulse-response-processing) opens automatically. In order to force recalculation, e.g. with changed parameters, the Integrated impulse response processing needs to be called from the Edit menu in the time domain window. An IIR previously calculated from this time signal is overwritten accordingly. Storing a time signal in WinMF format automatically saves the IIR with this file.

Inside the IIR domain only the [Decay times window](/en/help/info/decay-times), the Display menus and Plotting function are active, all other functions are of no use here.
