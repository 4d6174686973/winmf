# WinMF Display

The display windows for time signals and spectra are the main control elements for curve manipulation and display configuration. The cursors can be used to read out data points, to change the display range or to set ranges for editing functions.

There is a comment line above the plot area. This ``comment`` can be clicked on and then edited at will, which is terminated by ESC or clicking inside the window.

Several info panels and tools are available underneath the plot area. Visibility of tools is to be configured by the ``Display/Display configuration`` menu.
