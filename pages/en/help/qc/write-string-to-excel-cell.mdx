# Write to Excel Cell

The following options are available for the string export:

``File name only`` exports file name only (without path).

``Full file name`` exports file name including the path.

``Name`` exports the display name used in the "time signals" and "spectrum" object lists.

``Custom string`` exports a free input string.

The export options are the same as Excel export options in the info windows.
