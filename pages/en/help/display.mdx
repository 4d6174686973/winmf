The display consists of the pull-down menu, the plotting area and the display settings.

The plotting area contains two [cursors](/en/help/domain/cursor-control) to be controlled by mouse or [keyboard shortcuts](/en/help/domain/short-cuts).

Right underneath the plotting area the controls for [axes scaling](/en/help/display/axes-scaling) are to be found.

The level meter is located on the right, showing the level of the AD converters during and after a measurement. During the measurement the current level is shown, afterwards the maximum value is displayed. Weak levelling is shown in blue, good values (-20dBFS up to -3dBFS) in green, high levels (-3dBFS up to 0dBFS) are indicated in yellow and overload (more than 0dBFS) in red.
