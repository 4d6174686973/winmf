# Harmonic distortion (f)

The ``Harmonic distortion (f)`` measurement largely corresponds to a [Harmonic distortion](/en/help/adda/harmonic-distortion) measurement being performed consecutively for several frequencies.

Accordingly the frequency values to be evaluated need to be selected in the [Frequency steps setup](/en/help/adda/frequency-steps-setup).

Separate from the [Harmonic distortion](/en/help/adda/harmonic-distortion) menu ``Harmonic distortion (f)`` holds its own settings for analysing frequency dependent distortions. The configuration needs to be done under ``Dist./Distortion Setup`` before measuring. Definition and handling are equivalent to the [Distortion Info window](/en/help/info/distortion). The parameters chosen under Select are displayed in separate curves corresponding to the channels.
