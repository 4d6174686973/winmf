# ANTV1_Azi_MicArc_Ele

This menu combines the ANT turntable with a multi channel microphone arc.

The configuration of the microphone arc is done here:

Besides 4 standard presets, also arbitrary microphone angles can be used. Please note, that for EASE Speaker lab import aquidistant angle spacing is required.

The turntable will drive the azimuth angles, while the elevation is completely covered by the arc microphones.The elevation setup normally defined under polar-data-setup, is overwritten by the elevation angles of the mic arc. Microphone correction spectrum, preamp-gains and sensitivities of each input channel are set under Frontend as usual.

Is is recommended to use the Frontend "Digital", as it provides 128 homogenious channels.

The activated frontend channel count has to be identical to the number of defined microphone arcs.

For each microphone an individual distance can be set. It will be corrected with respect to the Mic. dist in the polar menu.

After each azimuth measurement, all channels are separated and stored under a name and format (*.spk), which can be imported by speaker lab.

All automation options, like channel and setup automation, are compatible to this measurement procedure.
