# ADDA

``ADDA`` records the activated channels, while an excitation signal is being played back on the activated output channels. A typical application for an ADDA measurement would be the acquisition of a system response to a STIPA excitation:

In the [Measurement setup](/en/help/adda/measurement-setup) the basic configuration for the measurement is set.

In the [Exciter setup](/en/help/adda/exciter-setup) section the signal, which shall be played back, and the playback level are to be specified.

The [Amplifier setup](/en/help/adda/amplifier-setup) contains parameters of amplifiers to be used.

By the [Processing](/en/help/adda/processing) section the measurement can be modified.

``OK`` starts measuring, ``Cancel`` quits the menu.
