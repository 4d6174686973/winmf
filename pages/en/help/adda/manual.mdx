# Manual

In ``Manual`` mode directivities and balloons can be measured without an automated rotator device. The turning of the loudspeaker and the relocation of the microphone between the measurements need to be carried out manually. The measuring can be triggered in time intervals or by pressing the ``Return`` key.

The picture shows an example where a manual microphone arc is used. The microphone, marked by the red circle, can be shifted along the white arc; the loudspeaker is marked by the arrow.
