# Play

The time signal displayed is played back through the activated outputs. Using the output matrix channels can be mixed at will.

``Mode`` defines whether the reference signal is played once or repeatedly. In repeat mode playback can be terminated by ``Escape``.

``Normalize`` defines which level the reference signals are normalised to. The options available are ``Max. all ch`` (the loudest sample of all channels is defined as 0dBFs), ``Calibr. SPL`` (see below), ``Calc. SPL`` (calculated SPL), ``Frontend V`` (maximum output voltage of the frontend) and ``Amp V`` (maximum output voltage of the amplifier).

``Calibr. SPL`` opens a new window, where frequency limits for a level calculation are to be specified (``Calibr. fu [Hz]`` and ``Calibr. fo [Hz]``). ``Calibr. SPL [dB]`` defines the reference level for the reference signal. ``Use input`` defines the input channel used for calibrating. A microphone needs to be connected to this channel and the correct sensitivity and pre amp gain values must be provided. The calibration levels are transferred to the frontend setup into Loads and Calibration where they can also be adjusted manually.

``Calibrate`` starts the calibration.

``Level [dBFs]`` defines the playback level of the normalised signal (only values lower or equal 0dBFs are accepted).

Inside the output matrix playback levels of channels can be adjusted separately. Rows represent the individual channels of the signal loaded, while columns represent activated output channels.
