# Polar data setup

``Polar data setup`` contains the settings for balloon and directivity measurements.

Numerous Presets are available covering frequent measuring tasks. All presets are editable and thus can be adjusted to more specific needs.

``El. start [°]`` / ``Azi. start [°]`` defines the angle at which the first horizontal / vertical measurement is to be performed; ``El. stop [°]`` / ``Azi. stop [°]`` is the equivalent for the last measurement. The angular range in between is passed through in steps specified by ``El. step [°]`` / ``Azi. step [°]``.

The ``Output files`` section defines what happens with the measured data.

With ``WinMF`` or ``SPK output`` activated each single measurement is stored as a single file in the respective format into the current directory.

``Copy to directivity`` editor directly transfers the measurement to the [Edit directivity](/en/help/direcitivty/edit-directicvity) section.

``Plot directivity`` creates a graphic from the measuring results.

The inputs from the fields ``Manufacturer, Loudspeaker type`` and ``Configuration`` under ``Measurement info`` are transferred directly to the corresponding section in [Edit directivity](/en/help/direcitivty/edit-directicvity).
