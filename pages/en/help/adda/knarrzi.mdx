# Knarrzi

``Knarrzi`` is a uniaxial turntable, which was built as a unique exemplar at the Institute of Technical Acoustics (ITA) in Aachen. It carries up to 300kg, so even measurements with several large line array elements are possible with ``Knarrzi``. The machine is controlled via serial port.
