# AD only

``AD only`` is a measuring method, in which an acoustic incident (e.g. noise, sound, music...) is being recorded.

In the [Measurement setup](/en/help/adda/measurement-setup) the basic settings for the measurement are to be undertaken.

In the [Processing](/en/help/adda/processing) section the recording can be processed.

``OK`` starts measuring, Cancel quits the operation.

The screenshot shows a simple AD measurement on one channel. After measuring the level meter at the bottom right displays the maximum recording level received. The bar turns red on overload, yellow up to -3dBFs, green between -3 and -20dBFs, and blue for the remaining level range down to -60dBFs.
