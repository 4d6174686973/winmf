# Edit balloon

This function is used for displaying balloon measurements. Here the three-dimensional balloon is plotted for a chosen frequency.

## Import

Here the directory is to be specified, which contains the balloon data as single measurements in spk format.

## Import options

``Angle step [°]`` defines the angle grading of the single measurements forming the balloon. Common angular resolutions are 10°, 5°, 2° and 1°.

If ``Import raw data`` is activated, the balloon is imported in the full frequency resolution of the spk files. If ``Import raw data`` is deactivated, the frequency resolution of the imported balloon is defined by ``Bandw. [1/oct]``.

``Frequency [Hz]`` sets the frequency to be shown.

``Renormalize`` makes a renormalization based on the redundant "north-pole" measurements.

``Export info`` shows the export options of the imported data.

## Export

[Export CLF](/en/help/directivity/clf-export) allows to export the ballons to various CLF formats.
