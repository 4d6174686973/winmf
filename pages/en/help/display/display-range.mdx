# Display range

Here the section to be plotted is defined.

For the x-axis the range is set as described in [Set region](/en/help/edit/region-control).

In the frequency domain additionally the y-axis range can be defined by entering upper (``Display max. [dB]``) and lower limit (``Display min. [dB]``).

In the time domain the y-axis range is set by entering the Display max. and Display min. values.

<Callout type="info">
  Short-cut: ``v`` sets the x-range to the values defined in the display range menu and closes the window.
</Callout>

These display settings can also be modified directly in the range section underneath the plotting area.
