# Display configuration

Under ``Display configuration`` the plotting area can be modified. ``Custom linear ticks`` and ``Custom dB ticks`` define rasters separately for x- and y-axis to be shown for more convenient reading of data values in the plot.

Under Display tools the different info sections underneath the plotting area can be switched on and off in order to make room for a larger plotting area. Furthermore the position and orientation of the legend within the plotting area is to be defined by ``Legend locat.`` and ``Legend orient.``. Text interpr. enables the use of Tex or Latex code for the legend.
