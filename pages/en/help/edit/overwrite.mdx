# Overwrite

Using ``Overwrite``, channels or segments can be overwritten by a constant complex value. The region to be modified is selected as described in Select region.

In [Complex factor](/en/help/edit/factor-control) the constant value is entered.

[Select channel](/en/help/edit/select-channel) defines the channel to be considered.

With ``Preserve phase`` selected, only the magnitude is overwritten, without the phase being modified.
