# Factor control

In the frequency domain ``Factor control`` allows to define a complex value in several representations. It can be typed in as ``Level [dB]``, ``Magnitude`` and ``Phase`` or as real and imaginary part (``Real``, ``Imag``).

In the time domain the value is entered as a linear factor or in dB.

Additionally, the dB references can be used to get dB values according to the current data in memory.

The other representations are automatically calculated and filled in according to the value entered.

``Copy from active cursor`` copies the value at the cursor position of the active cursor of the active channel to the controls. The dB reference is copied, too.
