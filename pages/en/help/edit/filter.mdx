# Filter

WinMF contains extensive filtering functions for modifying spectra.

First of all, ``Filter control`` allows to switch between display modes of the filters. ``Filter`` shows the selected filters applied to one or several channels, ``Set`` only shows the configured filters, while ``Set single channels`` displays each filter in a separate channel.

``Add new filter`` creates a new filter at the end of the list of filters.

``Delete filter`` erases the filter currently active.

``Copy`` copies the settings of the active filter, which can then be assigned to another filter by ``Paste``.

``Insert before`` creates a new filter in front of the active filter using the settings memorised by ``Copy``; ``Insert after`` correspondingly inserts the new filter behind the active filter.

``Interactive`` causes the current changes in the filter settings to be displayed instantly. In this mode the below described keyboard and mouse control is available (as long as the filter men√º is open).

Under ``Filter setup`` the actual filter parameters are set.

The first drop-down menu contains the list of all filters present, of which one is selected whose parameters are then editable. Next to the menu a name can be assigned to each filter.

``Bypass filter`` deactivates the current filter, ``Invert phase`` inverts the phase.

In the menu underneath the filter type is chosen. There are high-pass, low-pass, all-pass, bell filters (parametric EQ), as well as low- and high-shelf filters in 6dB and 12dB versions available.

For the high-pass, low-pass and all-pass filters the following filter characteristics are available: ``Butterworth``, ``Bessel``, ``Chebyshef PB (passband, type 1)``, ``Chebyshev SB (stopband, type 2)`` and ``Linkwitz-Riley``. Parameters to be configured are the ``filter order``, ``cut-off frequency`` and ``filter gain``. Furthermore, for ``Chebyshev PB`` the ``passband ripple`` and for ``Chebyshev SB`` the ``stopband attenuation`` are editable parameters.

``Bell`` filters feature the parameters ``gain``, ``frequency`` and ``quality``; ``Shelving`` filters only have ``gain`` and ``frequency``.

For all filters the phase can be selected as minimal, linear or maximum.

The selection of channels is described in [Select channel](/en/help/edit/select-channel).

``OK`` applies the configured filters to the corresponding channels, while ``Cancel`` aborts the operation.

The following plot shows some typical filters:

## Keyboard control (MF-style):
- Page up: decreases the filter number of the current filter.
- Page down: increases the filter number of the current filter. If the filter is the last filter in the filter list, a new filter is appended.
- Cursor left, right: decreases/increases the frequency. By pressing shift (step*10), strg  (step*100) or alt (step*0.1) the stepsize is modified.
- comma/period: decreases/increases the gain by 0.1dB. By pressing shift (step 1dB), strg  (step 10dB) or alt (step 0.01dB) the stepsize is modified.
- b: toggles the bypass option.
- c/v: decreases/increases the order of the filter.
- h: changes the filter characteristic (only if type is high- or lowpass).
- m/n: decreases/increases the quality of bell filters in 0.1 steps. By pressing shift (step 1), strg  (step 10) or alt (step 0.01) the stepsize is modified.
- t: changes the type of the filter.
- delete: deletes the active filter.
- escape/return: closes the filter menu without/with applying the filters.

## Mouse control:
- left mouse button: by modifying the active cursor (the yellow one) the frequency of the filter is changed.
- right mouse button: by going up/down the gain is changed
- mouswheel: changes the quality of the filter in 0.1 steps. By pressing shift (step 1), strg  (step 10) or alt (step 0.01) the stepsize is modified.
