# Multiply magnitude

``Multiply magnitude`` performs in the frequency range the multiplication of magnitudes of two channels.

[Select region](/en/help/edit/region-control) specifies the region to be considered for the operation.

|Target| = |Target| * |Source| describes the procedure: The product of magnitudes of the specified ``Target channel`` and ``Source channel`` is written into the ``Target channel``. The phase is not modified.

``Delete source`` eliminates the specified ``Source channel`` after the operation.

``Go for all`` multiplies the magnitude of the ?? by the magnitudes of all remaining channels.
