# Delete

Channels are deleted; the following channels are moved downwards correspondingly. The channel number to be deleted can be entered into the field ``Delete channel``, channel vectors are defined under ``Channel subset``. The syntax of a channel vector is described under [Channel subset syntax](/en/help/edit/channel-subset-syntax).

(The Control ``Delete channel`` was retained for macro operation for compatibility reasons)
