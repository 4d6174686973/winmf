# Average magnitude

This function averages the magnitudes of two or more channels. The phase of the ``Target channel`` is not modified.

[Select region](/en/help/edit/region-control) specifies the region to be considered for the operation.

``Target = (Target + Source) / n``  describes the procedure, with n being the number of channels averaged.

``Normalize before averaging`` performs a normalization of the curves to the [Log. average](/en/help/edit/log-average-adjust) value, relating to the region between ``Norm. start`` and ``Norm. stop``, before the averaging.

``Delete source`` eliminates the specified Source channel after the operation.

``Go for all`` averages all channels.
