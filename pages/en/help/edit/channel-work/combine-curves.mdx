# Combine curves

Purpose of this function is to create a curve by putting together parts of existing curves.

``Target channel`` specifies the channel, from which the upper part of the frequency range is taken. Magnitude and phase of this channel are preserved.

``Source channel`` specifies the channel which shall be appended at the bottom end of the ``Target channel``. Magnitude and phase are continuously merged into the Target channel.

``Frequency`` defines the frequency at which the two segments are put together.

``Delete source`` decides whether the Source channel is preserved or deleted.

The following example shows the [windowed](/en/help/edit/apply-window) measurement of a 15" woofer, the nearfield frequency response and the combined curve as magnitude- and phase-plot (below).
