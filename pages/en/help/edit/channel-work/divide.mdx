``Divide`` performs the (in the frequency domain the complex) division of two channels.

[Select region](/en/help/edit/region-control) specifies the region to be considered for the operation.

``Target = Target / Source`` describes the procedure: The (complex) quotient of the specified ``Target channel`` and ``Source channel`` is written into the ``Target channel``.

``Calc. dyn. [dB]`` sets the dynamic range for the division.

``Delete source`` eliminates the specified ``Source channel`` after the operation.

``Go for all`` divides the ``Target channel`` by all remaining channels.
