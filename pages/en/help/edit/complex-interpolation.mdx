# Complex interpolation

Calculates a complex interpolation with a user-defined [number of samples and samplerate](/en/help/edit/signal-length). If the samplerate is increased, zero padding is used to fill the undefined frequency range. The target values for ``samples`` and ``FFT`` are related to the corresponding impulse response of the complex spectrum. Example: if FFT=14 is used the number of lines will be $2^{13}+1 = 8193$.

Advice: Complex interpolation is working only if magnitude and phase response are smooth. Usually, most measured frequency responses are smooth enough to perform a complex interpolation. It is not useful to calculate a complex interpolation on noise spectrums.
