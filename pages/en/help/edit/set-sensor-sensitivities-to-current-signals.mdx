# Set sensor sensitivities to current signals

This function retroactively includes in a measurement result specific sensitivity settings for the sensors used. This is useful for example if by accident the sensitivities of the sensors have not been considered in a measurement in WinMF, or if the measurement has been imported and therefore contains incorrect results. For that the required values need to be set at the frontend. The assignment of the sensitivities in the frontend to the file corresponds to the numbering of inputs at the frontend. E.g. if for the file currently loaded sensitivity values of 10mV for channel 1 and 20mV for channel 2 shall be taken into account, at the frontend input 1 and 2 need to be set to 10mV and 20mV respectively. For each file this function can only be executed once; afterwards it is locked.
