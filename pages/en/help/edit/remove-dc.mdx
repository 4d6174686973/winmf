# Remove DC

``Remove DC`` eliminates the constant component from a signal. For this purpose in the frequency domain the magnitude at 0 Hz is set to zero, in the time domain correspondingly the constant component is subtracted. The channels are selected according to [Channel select](/en/help/edit/select-channel).
