# Weighting functions

``Weighting functions`` generates the spectra for common weighting functions. The functions available are ``A-Filter``, ``C-Filter``, ``EIA426B``, ``IEC268-1 progr.``, ``IEC268-16 male``, ``IEC268-16 female`` and ``pink (-3dB/oct.)``.

Additionally, attenuation of sound propagation in air can be calculated based on the parameters distance, air pressure, temperature and  relative humidity (using ISO 9613-1).
