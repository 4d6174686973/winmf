# Create curve

With ``Create curve`` a curve can be created from a table of data points. The table can be copied, for example, from excel. Pasting into the ``Create curve`` table is done by selecting a cell and calling the context menu by right-clicking. Using this procedure, all data found in the clipboard is used to replace the table data. Double data points are deleted.

Using the options in the ``length`` section, the parameters of the target curve are defined. The settings under ``Curve creation setup`` define the method of curve creation.
