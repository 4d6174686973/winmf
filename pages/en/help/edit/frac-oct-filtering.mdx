# Fractional octave filtering

``Fractional octave filtering`` allows filtering in the time and frequency domain using octave band or fractional octave band filters according to DIN EN 61260.

``Bandwidth [1/oct]`` defines the band width of the filters in fractions of octaves.

``Lower band [Hz]`` sets the center frequency of the lowest filter.

``Upper band [Hz]`` sets the center frequency of the highest filter.

``Reference [Hz]`` sets the reference center frequency. Based on this frequency all the center frequencies are determined, using the value chosen for Basis. With a Basis of 2 the center frequencies of the octave filters are separated exactly by the factor 2, with a Basis of 10 by the factor $10^{3/10}â‰ˆ1.99526$.

``Class 1 tol.`` and ``Class 2 tol.`` create tolerance curves according to the norm, illustrating the different degrees of tolerance.

If ``Create band level spectrum`` is activated, for each output curve a spectrum is created with the levels of the filtered bands.

The channel is chosen by [Select channel](/en/help/edit/select-channel).

After the filtering for each filter band there is a channel in the time domain.

As an example of an application the following plot shows motor noise recorded at 4 microphone positions.

After the octave band filtering, for each of the 4 channels the time signal is displayed in octaves, resulting in a total of 32 channels:

Using the [Info window](/en/help/info/statistics), statistical values of the filtered channels, such as crest factor or Leq, can be evaluated in detail.

If ``Create band level spectrum`` is activated, additionally the corresponding spectrum of band levels is created in the frequency domain:
