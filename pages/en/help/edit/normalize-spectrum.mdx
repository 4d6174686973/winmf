# Normalize spectrum

``Normalize spectrum`` aligns the level of channels at certain frequencies.

Under ``Normalize`` the frequency is specified, at which the curves are aligned

The value of the alignment is specified under [Factor control](/en/help/edit/factor-control).

The chosen [channels](/en/help/edit/select-channel) are adapted to the level at the specified frequency.

In the main window, the normalize function can be called by the short-cut [shift-1](/en/help/domain/short-cuts). The value of normalization is copied from the active cursor at the active channel.
