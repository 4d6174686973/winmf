# Add group delay

This function adds a group delay to the chosen channel (or all channels if option selected). The delay can be entered in the form of a distance in meter or in milliseconds. For the conversion between distance and time the speed of sound is assumed to be 344m/s.

Using ``Step up`` and ``Step down`` the chosen value can be added or subtracted repeatedly. ``Ok`` adds the value once, ``Cancel`` terminates the menu without any changes.
