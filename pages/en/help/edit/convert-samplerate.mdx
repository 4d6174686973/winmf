# Convert samplerate

This function changes the sampling frequency of a time signal.

In ``New samplerate`` the new sampling frequency is entered.

``#Supp. points`` is the number of samples adjacent to each side which are included in the calculation. Default value is 5. Higher values yield more accurate results at the expense of longer calculation times.

``Kaiser win para`` is a function parameter of the anti-aliasing filter, which is applied after the conversion in order to suppress unwanted effects in the higher frequency range by a low pass filter. Default value is 5. Higher values attenuate the side lobes and broaden them.
