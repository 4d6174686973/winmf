# Generate

Using the signal generator some of the classic signal can be created.

Under [Signal length](/en/help/edit/signal-length) the total length of the new signal as well as the sampling frequency need to be specified.

## Generator

Here several wave forms are available. Depending on the wave form different parameters can be configured.

### Sine

For ``sine`` at first the frequency is chosen.

The option ``round_to_int`` adjusts this value in such a way, that a number of whole periods fits the given signal length. For the application as an excitation signal this option needs to be activated, otherwise the requirement of absolute periodicity for FFT operations is not fulfilled (leakage effect).

In ``Amplitude [V]`` the peak value for the signal amplitude can be set.

### Rectangular

``Rectangular`` offers the same parameters as ``sine``, additionally ``Duty cycle [%]`` allows to choose, how long the positive peak value is held, in proportion to the whole period.

### Triangular

``Triangular`` uses the same parameters as sine.

### Sawtooth

``Sawtooth`` uses the additional parameter width, describing the length of the rising slope in proportion to the whole period. The range of values is from 0 to 1. With a width of 0.5, the sawtooth becomes a triangle.

### Noise

The length of a ``noise`` signal is specified as the FFT length (``FFT length noise``). Only integer input values are accepted, the signal consists of $2^N$ samples.

The parameter ``Slope [dB]`` represents a decrease of amplitude in the frequency domain in dB/octave.

``0dB at freq. [Hz]`` causes a displacement of the curve, so that the value at the frequency specified in this field is 0 dB.
