# A-weighting

This function applies to a frequency response the standardised (DIN EN 61672-1:2003-10) A-filter. The phase is not affected by this. In contrast to [A-filtering (IIR)](/en/help/edit/a-filtering-iir) the shape of the filter is independent from the sampling frequency and runs centred within the tolerance limits of the standard.

This function can only be applied once to a frequency response and is then blocked until [A-unweighting](/en/help/edit/a-unweighting) is executed.
