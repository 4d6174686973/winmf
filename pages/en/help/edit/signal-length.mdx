# Signal length

The signal length is specified as the total number of samples, in the form of the FFT length or as a length in seconds. Hereby an FFT length of N corresponds to a signal with $2^N$ samples. The FFT length is not necessarily integer. The length in seconds results from the number of samples divided by the sample rate.
