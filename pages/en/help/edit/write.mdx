# Write

The ``Write`` function allows exporting measurements to Excel, csv or several binary formats.

The range to be exported is defined as described in [Select region](/en/help/edit/region-control).

[Select channel](/en/help/edit/select-channel) sets the channel to be exported.

In the time domain the options available are the binary formats WinMF, Wave and the historical dat format from Monkey Forest, and the export to ASCII format.

In the frequency domain ``Write`` offers several options, in which form the data shall be exported. Store features the options real and imaginary part, level and phase, only level or magnitude and phase. ``Step`` allows choosing to export all frequency samples ``(lin)`` or in frequency bands ``(log)`` in fractions of octaves ``(Bandw. [1/oct.])``.

ASCII data is written to Excel or csv files as specified under [Write ascii options](/en/help/info/excelcsv-export).
