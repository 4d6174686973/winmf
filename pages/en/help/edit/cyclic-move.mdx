# Cyclic move

``Cyclic move`` shifts the time signal in such a way, that the sample at the active cursor becomes the start of the new signal, and the region in front of the active cursor is moved to the end.

``Select channel`` specifies the channel to be modified.

``Apply to all channels`` causes the operation to affect all channels.
