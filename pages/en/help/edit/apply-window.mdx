# Apply window

``Apply window`` creates a time window for blinding out unwanted sequences of the time signal. The window is displayed like an additional channel. Starting and ending point of the window are specified by the settings under ``Select Region``. The window preview is always updated when moving the cursors or by clicking the diagram.

``Window setup`` defines the shape of the time window. The following windows are available:

For the window shape ``tukeywin`` the ratio of the slopes, where the window function increases or decreases between 0 and 1, to the total length of the window can be modified as a parameter. The range of that value is from 0 to 1. The remaining middle part of the window is not modified. Also the windows ``Chebychef``, ``Gauss`` and ``Kaiser`` can be controlled in their course by parameters.

``Window slope`` defines, whether the window shall be symmetrical (sym), or the slope shall be located on one side only (right/left).

``Win. body length`` defines the ratio of pass through segment to slope length.

If the ``Instant FFT`` function is activated in the processing options, a new channel will be created in the frequency domain containing the windowed result. Changes applied to the window are passed on directly to the new channel. When leaving the ``Apply window`` menu by ``OK``, the newly created channel is kept in the frequency domain; leaving by ``Cancel`` deletes the channel, reproducing the initial state.

``Remove DC`` subtracts the DC component from the windowed region of the impulse response. Usually this leads to better high-pass characteristics in the windowed impulse response.

``Apply to all channels`` applies the window to all channels of the active file; if ``Apply to all channels`` is not activated, only the active channel is windowed. ``OK`` executes the window operation.
