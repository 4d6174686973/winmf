# Set external preamp gain to current signals

This function retroactively includes in a measurement result specific settings of preamp gains. This is useful for example if by accident the gain settings of the preamps have not been considered in a measurement in WinMF, or if the measurement has been imported and therefore contains incorrect results. For that the required values need to be set at the frontend. The assignment of the preamp gains in the frontend to the file corresponds to the numbering of inputs at the frontend. E.g. if for the file currently loaded preamp gain values of 10dB for channel 1 and 20dB for channel 2 shall be taken into account, at the frontend input 1 and 2 need to be set to 10dB and 20dB respectively. For each file this function can only be executed once; afterwards it is locked.
