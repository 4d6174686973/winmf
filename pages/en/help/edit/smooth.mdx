# Smooth

## Smooth (time signal)

Working area and channel are defined by [Select region](/en/help/edit/region-control) and [Select channel](/en/help/edit/select-channel).

Smoothing in the time domain is achieved through averaging within a sliding rectangular window. The width of the window in samples is set by the number of ``bins``.

## Smooth (spectrum)

Working area and channel are defined by [Select region](/en/help/edit/region-control) and [Select channel](/en/help/edit/select-channel).

### Smooth setup

Here the parameters for the operation are set. ``Process`` offers the options of ``continuous`` smoothing or smoothing in ``steps``.

### Continuous smoothing

Using continuous smoothing, the magnitude (``Smoothing of magnitude``), the group delay (``Smoothing of group delay``) or both (``Smoothing of both``) can be modified.

The region to be considered for the averaging can be specified linearly (``Method lin.`` by entering the number of evaluated frequency values (``bins``)) or logarithmically (``Method log.`` by entering the width of the evaluated frequency band in octaves (``Bandw. [1/oct.]``)).

### Smoothing in steps

The smoothing in steps is differentiated by two methods using averaging (``Method averaged``) or summation (``Method added (SPL)``).

The width of the steps is specified in octaves (``Bandw. [1/oct.]``).

The following plot shows an example of the different smoothing methods applied to the frequency response measurement of a sound reinforcement system.
