# Plot

Here the content of the plotting areas can be written into graphic files.

``Resolution`` is defined for the graphic file.

``Format`` allows a choice of graphic data types.

``Axes font`` and ``Legend font`` are defined for the respective labelling.

``write grafic``: a graphic file is created

``write matlab fig.``: a file in Matlab format is created

``OK`` starts plotting, Cancel aborts the operation. The plot is saved under the current path and file name with the file extension of the respective graphic format.
