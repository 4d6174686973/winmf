# Plotting multiple

``Plotting multiple`` allows plotting 2 or 3 different files in one diagram. This function is available for time domain and frequency domain.

In the [Plotting setup](/en/help/plot/plotting) graphic format, resolution and further options are to be set.

Under Data Source Setup the data sources as well as options for the origin of x-axis scaling, comment and file name are to be defined.

- Data Source Memory: the files present in the memory are available for selection from the ``Spectrums`` or Time Signals list

- Data Source Harddisk: files can be selected from data folders at will. The directories must be located under the [Base path](/en/help/file/preferences).

The following picture shows an example for a plot from 3 files containing sensitivity, impedance and unwrapped phase.

If only two files shall be plotted, the third plot must be switched off in the ``Data source setup``:
