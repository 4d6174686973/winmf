# File history

File history provides the functionality to manage and store a history of executed operations into a folder of the file system. Different operation modes and a management of shortcuts are available. The main intention of the file history menu is to support serial measurements and edit operations of any kind and furthermore provides a forward/backward function, so that complex edit operations can be executed easily.

10 setups can directly be accessed via shortcuts (F1-F10). To execute via shortcut functions F1 to F10 it is requiered that the window focus is within the file history window (click into the window). The function also can be executed by clicking the buttons directly.

The file history list collects the operations in a chronological order and numbered, the topmost element is the newest on.
