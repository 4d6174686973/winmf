# Load/Save/Import/Export

``Load file`` reads data stored in one of the WinMF format types. For the time domain the file extension is *.mda, for the frequency domain *.msp.

``Reload current file`` reloads the file with the name of the currently active one. So usually the file is just loaded anew. In case a new filename has been set by ``QC/set current filename``, this file will be loaded.

``Save file as`` opens a file browser for saving a file. After the operation the current filename is taken over by WinMF.

``Save`` uses the the current filename. Existing files of that name are overwritten without further enquiry. In case a new filename has been set by ``QC/set current filename``, the file is stored under this name.

``Save and plot`` additionally creates a plot. Existing files of that name are overwritten without further enquiry by the ``Save`` operation as well as by the ``Plot`` operation (short cut q).

``Save (autoincrement)`` stores under the current filename. If the file already exists, a new file is created by adding a serial number to the current filename. E.g. current filename is "Test.msp". If ``Save (autoincrement)`` is executed and the file already exists in the current directory, a file with the name "Test_000001.msp" is written. With the next function call "Test_000002.msp" is created and so on.

## Monkey forest

``Import *.spk`` imports spectra from Monkey Forest.

``Export as *.spk`` exports spectra in Monkey Forest format.

``Export *.spk`` exports Monkey Forest spectra using the current path and filename. Existing files of that name are overwritten without further enquiry. In order to export spk files within a macro this function is to be used.

``Import/Export *.dat`` imports/exports Monkey Forest time signals.

``Import/Export *.wav`` imports/exports wav files. Wave formats available are 16bit integer and 32bit float.

## Matlab raw data

Matlab import and export functions work with the following variables inside a Matlab file:

- data: two-dimensional array, each row contains a channel vector

- samplerate: sample rate of data

If 'data' is non-existent, the import is aborted. When importing an array into the time domain, only the real part is used.

If 'samplerate' is non-existent, the sample rate of the file currently displayed in WinMF is used.

``Import *.mat`` imports Matlab data.

``Export as *.mat`` exports Matlab data.

``Export *.mat`` exports Matlab data using the current path and filename. Existing files of that name are overwritten without further enquiry. In order to export mat files within a macro this function is to be used.
