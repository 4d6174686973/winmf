# Preferences

This menu contains some general settings.

## Path and basic settings

``Exciter path`` defines the standard directory for loading excitation signals. So the signals to be selected must be located in this folder and its subdirectories, which is a restriction in a way, but ensures that macros can be run on different systems without the need for changes.

``Base path`` defines the standard directory for any file operation occurring within a macro. This concerns for example the export functions from the info windows and all QC functions. The current directory for loading WinMF files and the import/export functions are exceptions. The general definition of a directory for macro relevant functions is equally necessary in order to ensure portability of macros.

``Generate sweeps in exciter`` path creates a set of popular sweeps for measuring which is stored in the Exciter path. Specific sweeps can be generated using the [Sweep generator](/en/help/edit/sweep-generator).

``Show QC process control at startup`` automatically opens the process control window on startup.

``Start QC automation at startup`` launches a process automation after starting WinMF.

With ``Offline help`` being activated, WinMF uses the locally stored help page. It needs to be stored in a folder named "Help" inside the WinMF installation directory. The current help files can be downloaded here: www.ifaa-akustik.de/data/Help.zip

``Help language`` defines the language for the help page.

``Store measurement setup in file`` additionally stores into the WinMF file frontend setup and measuring menu used for a measurement. Under [Spectrums/Time](/en/help/time-signalsspectrums) signals these setting can be restored from the file.

``Check for updates at startup`` synchronises WinMF, offline help and other necessary components with the version present on the WinMF server. Internet connection is required and WinMF needs to be unblocked by the firewall.

``Decimal separator in tables is point`` sets the decimal separator in tables to '.', otherwise it is ','.

``Windows always at default position``: all windows are opened in the left upper corner of the calling window.

``Reset all window positions`` sets the saved values for the window position to the default value.

## Measurement

``Use filename as legend`` uses the filename as legend. An existing legend will be overwritten. This function will be applied only when a file is loaded.

``Copy path after FFT/IFFT to other domain`` copies the path of the original file to the other domain.

``Use cal-file.txt in WinMF folder to calibrate Frontend values``: settings in this calibration file allows the user to overwrite frontend settings individually: [Documentation of Calibration file](/en/help/file/cal-file)

``All outs are normalized to exciter Volt. or amp. Watt`` (line internal/external): normalizes over all activated channels also inhomogeneous outputs  to the defined voltage. This option has to be activated if reference measurements are used over inhomogeneous channels.

``Use sensor ident as legend`` uses the sensor identifier of the Frontend Setup in the legend

``T_ref (for delay calc.) [Â°C]``: the here defined value serves to calculate the speed of sound for the menu ``Edit/add group delay`` and within the internal post-processing applied to ADDA/Polar response in the case of using a microphone arc with different microphone distances.

``Acquire lab temp, humid.``: definiton and use of a sensor to acquire laboratory temperature and humidity (see [Configure lab. temp, humi](/en/help/file/lab-ht)).
