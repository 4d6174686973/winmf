# WinMF 

This website is created with the [Nextra](https://nextra.site) template. See [Nextra Docs](https://nextra.site/docs) for development.

For multi language support [nextra v3](https://the-guild.dev/blog/nextra-3) is needed as stated in this [issue](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/issues/3139). 

This site is built on a clone of [swr website](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/v3/examples/swr-site) which uses nextra v3.
